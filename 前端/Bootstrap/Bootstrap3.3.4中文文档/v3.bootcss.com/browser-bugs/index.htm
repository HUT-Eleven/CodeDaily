  <p class="lead">Bootstrap currently works around several outstanding browser bugs in major browsers to deliver the best cross-browser experience possible. Some bugs, like those listed below, cannot be solved by us.</p>
  <p>We publicly list browser bugs that are impacting us here, in the hopes of expediting the process of fixing them. For information on Bootstrap's browser compatibility, <a href="../getting-started/index.htm#support" tppabs="http://v3.bootcss.com/getting-started/#support">see our browser compatibility docs</a>.</p>
